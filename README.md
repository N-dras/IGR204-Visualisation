In this mini-project, we will be working with a data set of baby names in France. It contains the list of all baby names registered in France, year by year, from 1900 through 2019. There are two data sets: one aggregated to the national level, and another with data by department. We will answer the above questions with an interactive visualization made with Tableau. 

**Part 1:** 
- How do baby names evolve over time? 
- Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? 
- Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? 
- Are there trends in time?

**Part 2:** 
- Is there a regional effect in the data? 
- Are some names more popular in some regions? 
- Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?

**Part 3 (bonus):** 
- Are there gender effects in the data? 
- Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently? (Note: this data set treats sex as binary; this is a simplification that carries into this assignment but does not generally hold.)

Here is the general aspect of our dashboard :
