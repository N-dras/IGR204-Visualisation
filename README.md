In this mini-project, we will be working with a data set of baby names in France. It contains the list of all baby names registered in France, year by year, from 1900 through 2019. There are two data sets: one aggregated to the national level, and another with data by department. We will answer the above questions with an interactive visualization made with Tableau. 

Here is the general aspect of our dashboard :

#### Part 1:
- How do baby names evolve over time?
- Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? 
- Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? 
- Are there trends in time? 

By moving the mouse over this bubble graph, you can see the top 3 years in which a name has been given more.

By clicking on the name John, the graph below shows us the general tendency given to this name. We can see that it is in 1946 that this name has been given the most. Names evolve over time.

Taking the window 2000-2020, several names have become unpopular, the first name Jean seen before has been replaced in the early 2000s by Louis, however Marie remains in the Top 3 of the most given names in 2020 with Jeanne.

We can deduce that Marie remains a name very loved by the French, even if it tends to be replaced. 

#### Part 2:
- Is there a regional effect in the data? 
- Are some names more popular in some regions? 
- Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?

While the first names Marie and Jean remain very popular in particular in Finist√®re, it is interesting to see that in Seine-saint-denis the Top 3 names are : 
- Mohamed
- Nicolas
- Stephane
History has something to do with it. Indeed, many Maghreb countries were colonized by the French. After the 2nd world war, there was a migration of the countries of the south towards the north and it is particular in the department of the seine-saint-denis that these people ce are installed. A wave of births followed, hence the name Mohamed became very popular.

#### Part 3 (bonus):
- Are there gender effects in the data? 
- Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently? (Note: this data set treats sex as binary; this is a simplification that carries into this assignment but does not generally hold.)
